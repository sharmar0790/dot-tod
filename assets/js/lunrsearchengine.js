    "body": "Director Roland Suso Richter’s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney’s own play “Point of Death” - a title that gave away the film’s entire plot twist premise. As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: “When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?” The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”). Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside. ” (The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film’s ending. ) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!). A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there’s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is. So how do we do spoilers?: 1&lt;span class= spoiler &gt;My hidden paragraph here. &lt;/span&gt;"

    "body": "Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

    "body": " I’ve been through fire and water, I tell you! From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

(If you don’t want Bundler to install the gems, use jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle. ) By default, the Jekyll site installed by jekyll new uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.  We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use jekyll new myblog --blank To learn about other parameters you can include with jekyll new, type jekyll new --help.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

    "body": "As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

It allows and define which container can talk to which and which are all container can be combine together. This is a pluggable subsystem using drivers. Types of Docker networking  bridge host Overlays ipvlan macvlan noneIn this page, I am going to discuss about each networking options one-by-one. Let’s start bridge: Bridge network is the Link layer device which forwards the all the traffic between network segments. Docker uses a software based bridge networking device. Bridge networking allows container to communicate with each other which are connected to the same bridge network. This also isolate these containers from outside which are not connected to the same bridge network. here, the idea is if we want to group together some containers and do not want them to be accesses by others’ container on the same host then we can spin up all thoese containers under a bridge network. We can create multiple bridge network, so container belongs to network bridge-A will not be able to those connected to network bridge-B. This is de-facto default network type. When we do not provide any network by --network flags during dockwer run command, then docker by default create the container in bridge host. Bridge network apply to those containers running on same docker host machine. Check the networksdocker network ls Output 12345$ docker network lsNETWORK ID   NAME   DRIVER  SCOPE21fdfd7ad08c  bridge  bridge  localfb231c81ea6a  host   host   locale7861043a1f3  none   null   localBy default, docker comes up with default bridge network. If we want we can create user define bridge network as well. Difference between default and user define bridge network    CommunicationContainer within default bridge network can communicate to each other using IP Address on the other hand in case of user define bridge network they can communicate using containers name. Imagine an application with a web front-end and a database back-end. If you call your containers web and db, the web container can connect to the db container at db, no matter which Docker host the application stack is running on.     Better IsolationBy default, when we spin a new container they all connect to a default one, where we might be creating all other containers hence does not provide better isolation. But you’ll get the better isolation in case of user define bridge network.     Better ControlControl we cannot control or change anything in default bridge network as it is outside of control of docker and also require restart of docker itself. But on the other hand we get better control on user define one and we can also attach/detach containers on the fly without even restarting the docker.  "

    "body": "2023/09/07 - Kubernetes Ingress ControllerWhat is Kubernetes Ingress Controller?: Moving production workloads to Kubernetes has many benefits, but it also increases the complexity of managing application traffic. An ingress controller is a dedicated load balancer for Kubernetes clusters. An ingress controller is a component that abstracts the complexity of routing application traffic within a Kubernetes cluster, providing a bridge between Kubernetes services and external services. An ingress controller is configured using objects called Ingress Resources, managed via the Kubernetes API. The main functions of a Kubernetes ingress controller are to receive and load-balance traffic from outside Kubernetes to pods running in a Kubernetes cluster, and manage egress traffic from services within the cluster to services outside the cluster. They monitor pods running on Kubernetes and automatically update load balancing rules when pods are added or removed from a service. This is part of a series of articles about Kubernetes API gateway. Kubernetes Ingress Controller Benefits and Limitations: Technically, an ingress is not a service, it is a layer 7 (application layer) router that is typically exposed through a load balancer service. It is cheaper than using a cloud load balancer for each service as it relies on an ingress controller which is hosted together with the application. It ensures each service has only one IP that can be accessed from the internet, and traffic intended for this IP is routed to the correct service by the ingress controller. Benefits of ingress controllers include::  Provides secure access to services over HTTP or HTTPS paths, instead of using direct connections.  Creates access routes to multiple services, with full control over routing of services and conditions for external access.  Creates a single path for ingress traffic, which can be modified based on conditions defined by the operator, instead of opening many connections to access a Kubernetes application.  Simplifies management of complex ingress processes, with the ability to easily manage access to multiple services in one system. This can have a significant impact on performance and management costs of large systems.  All ingress controllers support a set of annotations that enable specific software-based features. For example, in the Traefik ingress controller, users can use annotations to add middleware to ingress, even if not supported by the Ingress specification. Limitations of ingress controllers::  The Ingress controller only handles layer 7 traffic, while an ingress routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This means it is not possible to route TCP and UDP traffic.  Ingress is used in a single namespace. This means that anything within a Kubernetes namespace can only reference services within the same namespace. To solve this problem, Kubernetes has introduced a gateway API specification, which enables cross-namespace communication. This specification is still in alpha status. A Kubernetes-native API Gateway can be used today for cross-namespace communications. How to choose an ingress controller: There are several ingress controllers available in Kubernetes, each has advantages and preferred use cases. It can be challenging to select the ingress controller suitable for your needs. If you’re managing a small production environment and don’t plan to scale it, you probably need only the standard features such as load balancing, flow control, and flow splitting. Be careful not to select a controller that has more functionality than you need, because this can negatively impact performance and create unneeded management complexity. However, if your application runs in a distributed, multi-cloud environment, you may need an enterprise-grade, high-performance networking solution. Ingress Controller Solutions: Kubernetes currently provides two ingress solutions by default —GCE L7 Load Balancer (GLBC) and ingress-nginx. You can use other solutions, but you’ll have to first deploy them in your Kubernetes cluster. Here is a full list of ingress controllers supported by Kubernetes. We’ll cover a few popular open source solutions. Istio Ingress: Istio Ingress is a service mesh solution that can also serve as an ingress controller, regulating outside traffic entering a Kubernetes cluster. Istio makes use of Envoy proxies, deployed in a sidecar container alongside every exposed service in the cluster. Envoy offers advanced traffic routing and observability capabilities. When Istio is used as an ingress solution, it runs completely separated from services, intercepting all traffic and collecting metrics, tracing headers, and applying JWT authentication. NGINX: Ingress-nginx is an open-source ingress controller built into the official Kubernetes distribution. It is based on the NGINX reverse proxy, and provides simple HTTP/S routing and SSL capabilities. NGINX Plus provides an expanded version of the basic ingress-nginx controller, with improved performance and additional features, including tracing, active health checks, JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, and OpenID single sign on (SSO). It is a commercial software product sold on a subscription basis by NGINX, Inc. Traefik: Traefik, created by Containous, was originally built as an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer with dynamic routing capabilities. It is written in Go, allowing it to support Kubernetes as well as other container environments. Traefik offers HTTP/2, WebSocket, and certificate encryption based on Let’s Encrypt (an open certificate authority) by default making it easy to implement for beginners. It also provides a UI that visualizes controller and Kubernetes metrics. Kong Ingress: Kong was originally designed as an API Gateway. Recently, its makers added gRPC support, active health checks on load balancers, and request/response authentication, making it a good option for Kubernetes ingress. Kong has the benefit of blocking privilege escalation by ensuring the controller can only operate in one Kubernetes namespace. "

In this article, we’ll explore the basics of Kubernetes Ingress, and the process of installing Traefik Ingress controller on a Kubernetes cluster, and how you can utilize it to manage traffic in a Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes Ingress is a resource that defines rules for managing external traffic to Kubernetes services. This resource has rules that define how traffic is routed to different Kubernetes services based on criteria such as hostnames, paths, and protocols. An Ingress Controller is a component within Kubernetes that manages incoming traffic to Kubernetes internal services. An Ingress controller is used to manage traffic at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and also for terminating SSL/TLS and provide load balancing capabilities. Main functions of an Ingress Controller: Receive incoming external traffic and forwards it to the appropriate Kubernetes backend service. Implements routing rules specified in an Ingress resource. Handles SSL/TLS encryption and decryption – SSL termination. Provides load balancing capabilities to distribute traffic across multiple pods and nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. There are several Ingress Controllers available for use in Kubernetes environment, and each has its own set of features and capabilities. The one that we’ll use in this article is Traefik Ingress Controller.

Introduction: Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integratemicroservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policiesand aggregate telemetry data. Istio’s control plane provides an abstractionlayer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes. Istio is composed of these components:    Envoy - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic between services in the cluster and from a service to external services. The proxies form a secure microservice mesh providing a rich set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers, policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting functions.      Note: The service mesh is not an overlay network. Itsimplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to eachother over the network provided by the underlying platform.       Istiod - The Istio control plane. It provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management. It consists of the following sub-components:          Pilot - Responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.           Citadel - Responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.           Galley - Responsible for validating, ingesting, aggregating, transforming and distributing config within Istio.          Operator - The component provides user friendly options to operate the Istio service mesh.  Repositories: The Istio project is divided across a few GitHub repositories:    istio/api. This repository definescomponent-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio platform.     istio/community. This repository containsinformation on the Istio community, including the various documents that governthe Istio open source project.     istio/istio. This is the main code repository. It hosts Istio’score components, install artifacts, and sample programs. It includes:          istioctl. This directory contains code for theistioctl command line utility.           operator. This directory contains code for theIstio Operator.           pilot.

Issue management: We use GitHub to track all of our bugs and feature requests. Each issue we track has a variety of metadata:    Epic. An epic represents a feature area for Istio as a whole. Epics are fairly broad in scope and are basically product-level things. Each issue is ultimately part of an epic.     Milestone. Each issue is assigned a milestone. This is 0. 1, 0. 2, …, or ‘Nebulous Future’. The milestone indicates when wethink the issue should get addressed.     Priority. Each issue has a priority which is represented by the column in the Prioritization project. Priority can be one ofP0, P1, P2, or &gt;P2. The priority indicates how important it is to address the issue within the milestone. P0 says that themilestone cannot be considered achieved if the issue isn’t resolved.
